                      Sendler’s mother was Janina Krzyżanowska, and her father was Stanisław Krzyżanowski, who was a doctor. As a child, Irena lived in Warsaw, however due to her illness, her family moved to Otwock. The girl had no siblings, so she would willingly play with her Jewish peers, from whom she learned the Yiddish language. 
                      In 1917 Sendler’s father died from epidemic typhus, and she moved with her mother to Tarczyn and later on to Piotrkowo Trybunalskie. That’s where she met her first future husband Mieczysław. 
                      In 1927, she left to study in the Faculty of Law at the University of Warsaw. After 2 years she transferred to the Faculty of Humanities. However, she stopped her studies in 1932-1937. She worked i.a. in the Mother and Child Care Section, the Legal Clinic of the Committee or in the Care and Health Center.  
                      In 1931 she got married to Mieczysław Sendler.

                      During the German occupation, she was employed as a social worker. She had completed a nursing course and worked in health centers. In 1939, helping the Jewish population was deemed as forbidden. But despite that, a group of aid workers organized by Sendler still continued to help Jews. 
                      She had obtained ID cards for employees of the sanitary column who fought against infectious diseases in the ghetto for herself and Irena Schultz. The pass allowed entering the ghettos, so Sendler and Schultz made use of it and kept bringing food, clothes, money and medicines to the ghettos. 
                      She had been preparing fake community interviews, changing Jewish children's resumes. This allowed them to be referred to care facilities as Polish orphans. Sendler also helped adults escape.

                      In 1942, she made contact with the Council to Aid Jews “Żegota” and reported to the Welfare and Health Department operating in the underground. She was subordinated to the management of Żegota. Sendler looked after 8-10 flats in which Jews were hiding. In 1943, she became the head of the "Żegota’s" children's section and led an encrypted file of children and adults covered by the aid. 
                      In 1943, she was arrested by the Gestapo because she was exposed by the owner of the laundry. “Żegota” managed to save her by paying a large bribe. After being freed, she continued her activities under the name of Klara Dąbrowska. 
                      She became a nurse during the uprising in Mokotów and participated in the establishment of the hospital. 
                      According to post-war reports, as a result of the actions of Żegota, an attempt to save about 2,500 Jewish children had been made, but not all of them managed to survive the war.

                      In 1945 Sendler was offered a job in the Social Welfare Department, so she started organizing orphanages, old people's homes and nursing homes. After the merger of the Polish Workers’ Party and the Polish Socialist Party, she became a member of the Polish United Workers' Party. After that, she had worked in many places, but she eventually retired in 1967. In 1965 she was awarded the title of Righteous Among the Nations, and in 1991 she was granted honorary citizenship of Israel. After the war, she was questioned many times by functionaries of the Public Security Office, because she had been accused of employing members of the Home Army. In 1980, she joined the Independent Self-governing Trade Union "Solidarity".

                      After the war, she began to experience health problems caused by constant stress and head injuries sustained during Gestapo interrogations.

She died on May 12 2008, and the funeral took place on May 15 at the Powązki Cemetery in Warsaw.
