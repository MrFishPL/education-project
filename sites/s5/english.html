              Born on 3rd August 1901, at exactly 3 a.m Zuzela village, on the border between Mazowsze and Podlasie regions. His parents were Stanisław, a church organist and Julianna née Karp. Baptized and brought up in a religious spirit, in particular Marian devotion, he oriented himself towards the future priesthood. Then, at the age of 9, he moved with his family to Andrzejewo, where he was almost expelled from school due to a conflict with a teacher. The same year his mother died and told him ante-mortem that he should become a priest, saying <q>Stefan - dress yourself... Dress yourself, but don't dress like that, dress differently</q>. A year later he received his First Communion, and two years later, in 1912, he became a pupil of the Wojciech Górski Gymnasium in Warsaw. Due to the First World War, he moved to the Private Seven-Class Men's Commercial School in Łomża.

              Stefan Wyszyński started out as a cleric, which he was in years 1920-1924. He was ordained a deacon on 5th april 1924 and priest on 3rd August in the same year (which was his 23rd birthday) in the Chapel of Our Lady in the Cathedral Basilica of Wloclawek by Bishop Wojciech Owczarek. He celebrated his first Mass on 5th August in the Chapel of Our Lady of Czestochowa at Jasna Góra. In October 1924 he became a vicar in a parish in Wloclawek and editor of the diocesan newspaper <q>Słowo Kujawskie</q>. From 1925 to 1929 he was a student at the Catholic University of Lublin, which he completed with a doctorate in canon law on 22 June 1929, writing a thesis on The Right of the Church and State Family to School. Also during his studies he participated in social actions, among others in the Catholic Academic Youth Association <q>Odrodzenie</q> (Revival) and in the <q>Bratnia Pomoc</q> - a self-help organization<br/>

When he finished his studies he travelled extensively to observe how Catholic social thought was developing in other European countries. 

              Another influence on his church life was Father Władysław Korniłowicz, a venerable servant of God and his best friend. He introduced him to Róża Czacka, with whom he wrote many works, including <q>The Work of Cardinal Ferrari</q>. Also, two years before the start of the Second World War, he became a chaplain and an activist of the <b>Stronnictwo Pracy</b> (a Christian political party) and was appointed a member of the Social Council at the side of the Primate of Poland. During the Second World War he became chaplain to the blind in Kozłówka and Żułów, to the Lasek Institution for the Blind and to the <b>Armia Krajowa</b> during the Warsaw Uprising, at which time he took the pseudonym <q>Radwan III</q>. In the meantime he led the <b>Secular Institute of the Helpers of Mary, Mother of the Church of Jasna Góra</b>, otherwise known as <q>Ósemka</q>.<br/>

              A year after the end of the war he became Bishop of Lublin, pre-consecrated by the then Pope - Pius XII, and in his crest he put <q>Soli Deo</q>, which means To God Himself.For this, two years later, by the will of his predecessor - August Hlond, he was appointed Primate of Poland. After assuming the Primate's office, he held two intercessions in Gniezno and Warsaw. He was elevated to the dignity of Cardinal in 1953, on 12th January. He participated four times in the conclave, i.e. the assembly to elect the Pope.

            <p>
            The early 1950s were a period of tension between the Church and the authorities of the time, as one of the communist ideas was the total removal of religion from society and also, the Church was an independent institution that the authorities wanted to remove. However, with the help of the bishop of Łódź, Michał Klepacz, on 14th April 1950, Stefan Wyszyński concluded an agreement with the communist authorities. He considered the signing of the agreement as a necessity, thanks to which the Church could afford to act more freely. <br/><br/>

The agreement included a condemnation of the criminal activity of <q>Podziemie</q>, which the Church undertook to fight. Having heard this, the then Pope wanted to withdraw recognition from Primate Wyszyński, because he himself had pursued an anti-communist policy.
However, it was possible to restore religion classes in Polish schools and the Catholic University of Lublin (points 10th and 11th of the Church-State Agreement) was reopened in exchange for the Polish Church's recognition of the country's new borders, the so-called <q>Ziemie Odzyskane</q> (Recovered Territories). The Church-State agreement did not last long, on 8 May 1953, on the initiative of the Primate, a letter was written to the government (called <b>Non possumus</b>), and it was an objection to the violation of the principles of the agreement by the authorities, which led to its subsequent dissolution.<br/><br/>

The first major repression was the decision to intern Primate Wyszyński, which was handled by the <q>Ministerstwo Bezpieczeństwa Publicznego</q> (Ministry of Public Security), and he himself was arrested on 25th September 1953, in the House of the Archbishops of Warsaw, by functionaries of the <q>Urząd Bezpieczeństwa</q> (Security Office). He was released from internment only 3 years later.  He then conducted many great celebrations, the most important being the celebration of the Millennium of the Baptism of Poland. On 8th December, he concluded a new agreement with the authorities, the so-called “Małe Porozumienie”, and also urged Poles to vote for Władysław Gomułka, because he believed that accepting the communist system would lead to less bloodshed. Then, 7 years after his death, the beatification process began, with Father Jerzy Mrówczyński as postulator. In 2012, the process began regarding the healing of a Szczecin resident who had thyroid cancer, then in 2015 the positio, the documents used in the beatification process, was submitted, and on October 2, 2019, he signed the decree of healing of the Szczecin resident, at the same time approving the beatification process. It was due to take place on June 7, 2020, but was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic to April 23, 2021, and actually took place on September 12 of the same year at <q>Świątynia Opatrzności Bożej</q> in Warsaw.

            <p>
Unfortunately, in March of 1981 he was diagnosed with cancer, despite the doctors' efforts, on 16th March he received the sacrament of the anointing of the sick, and 6 days later he made his last public appearance, and his death occurred 6 days later at 4:40 a.m. His funeral took place on 31 May, starting with a funeral procession, and after it reached <q>Plac Zwycięstwa</q>, a mass began. He was placed in a coffin, in a stone sarcophagus in the basement of the archcathedral, and after five years was transferred to a chapel dedicated to him.<br/><br/> Then, 7 years after his death, the beatification process began, with Father Jerzy Mrówczyński as postulator. In 2012, the process began regarding the healing of a Szczecin resident who had thyroid cancer, then in 2015 the positio, couple of documents used in the beatification process, was submitted and on 2nd October 2019 pope Francis signed the decree of healing of the Szczecin resident, at the same time approving the beatification process. It was due to take place on June 7, 2020, but was postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic to April 23, 2021, but took place on September 12 of the same year at the temple of <q>Opatrzność Boża</q> in Warsaw.
