          Rotmistrz Witold Pilecki- the hero from Auschwitz, we all heard his
          story at least once, on a history lesson, in radio or tv. His story,
          however, never found its time in our lives, so we invite you to get to
          know his inspirational person.

          Born on May 13, 1901 in the Eastern Borderlands in a Polish family of
          the Leliwa coat of arms. He had 4 siblings, with whom he lived in
          Ołońc until 1910. He moved with his family to Vilnius, where he
          started studying at a trade school, and joined the scouting movement
          forbidden by the Russians. During World War I, after Vilnius was taken
          over by the Germans, he escaped with his family to his uncle in the in
          the area of Vitebsk. There he met with a conspiratorial,
          anti-occupation environment. In 1915, he was the deputy of the
          "Puhaczy", by the name of Prince Józef Poniatowski, but in 1916 he
          created his own scout team.

          When in 1918 Polish scouting came out of the underground, Pilecki and
          his troop attempted to rob a military warehouse, and then together
          with older scouts made their way to the reborn Poland. In the years
          1918-1921 he served in the Polish Army, and fought during the war with
          the Bolsheviks. He spent the interwar period studying at the Stefan
          Batory University at the Faculty of Fine Arts, however he stopped his
          studies. Pilecki married Maria Ostrowska in 1931. In August 1939 he
          was mobilized to serve in the Polish Army. After the end of the
          September Campaign, Pilecki has made his way to Warsaw, where he has
          become one of the organizers of the underground organization of the
          Secret Polish Army, established on November 9, 1939, under the command
          of Major Jan Włodarkiewicz. Pilecki simultaneously performed two
          functions in this organization - that of the chief of the
          organizational and mobilization branch, as well as the chief of the
          armament department of the armament and special services division. He
          supervised and set up a network of secret hiding places for documents
          and firearms. The Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp caught the
          attention of the organization, to which Pilecki belonged, when the
          Gestapo arrested Władysław Surmacki - the Chief of Staff. During one
          of the TAP sessions, the matter of concentration camps was discussed.
          It was then proposed, that one of the members get through to him. It
          was declared, that the goal of this action would be to free the
          prisoners through an escape. According to some sources, Pilecki was to
          be the initiator, while according to others, the rotamaster was only
          to volunteer to carry it out.

          <br />
          Not much was known at the time the operation began about Auschwitz, it
          was only about 3 months after its inception. Pilecki was to infiltrate
          the camp and then obtain information about it, while helping the
          prisoners and keeping them spirited. On September 19, 1940, he was
          caught in a round-up in Żoliborz. In the camp, Pilecki founded the
          underground organization ZOW (Military Organization Union), which
          fulfilled the tasks set by the captain. Its operation was based on the
          Friday system, which was to spread the organization through groups of
          five leaders who did not know about each other, which ensured the
          organization's sustainability, regardless of the course of events.
          Pilecki prepared many reports in the camp, which he then sent to the
          command in Warsaw. For his underground activity, Pilecki, while still
          a camp prisoner, was promoted by General Stefan "Grot" Rowecki to the
          rank of lieutenant in November 1941. On the night of April 26-27,
          1943, Pilecki and two fellow prisoners managed to escape from the
          camp. They got to the Vistula River by going along the railroad
          tracks, which they swam across by boat. After a long journey, the
          refugees managed to get to Nowy Wiśnicz, where Tomasz Serafiński put
          him in touch with the Polish Army units.

              After the execution of Rotmistrz, his body disappeared. This
              disappearance was part of a campaign to forget the Polish hero by
              the communist authorities.To this day, it is not known where his
              body rests.
