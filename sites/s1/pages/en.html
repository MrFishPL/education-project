                            <p>Maria była najmłodszym dzieckiem rodziny nauczycielskiej. Już od najwcześniejszych lat przejawiała wysoką inteligencję, prawdopodobnie potrafiła czytać już w wieku 4 lat. Mając 10 lat rozpoczęła roczną edukacje w prywatnej pensji dla dziewcząt prowadzonej przez matkę. Następnie uczęszczała do III Gimnazjum Żeńskiego, które ukończyła w 1883 r. ze złotym medalem. Młoda Skłodowska poznawała nauki przyrodnicze w latach 1884-85 r. uczęszczając do nielegalnego „Latającego Uniwersytetu”. Pracowała również jako guwernantka u właścicieli ziemskich w okolicy Płocka. Dalszą wiedzę z zakresu fizyki i chemii uzupełniała w pracowni naukowej Muzeum Przemysłu i Rolnictwa. W zaborze rosyjskim kobiety nie mogły studiować na uczelniach wyższych, dlatego Maria w 1891 r. wyjechała do Paryża, by kontynuować naukę na Sorbonie. Ukończyła dwa kierunki: w 1893 r. fizykę, rok później uzyskała dyplom z matematyki. Pracę doktorską z zakresu fizyki obroniła w 1903 r., tym samym, w którym dostała pierwszą Nagrodę Nobla.</p>

                        <div class="title">Childhood</div>
                        <p>
                            Maria Skłodowska Curie was born in 1867 in Warsaw. She spent her childhood and youth in this city. From an early age, she was very talented. She quickly learned how to read and write. She grew up in a family of teachers. Her father Władysław was a physicist and mathematician, so he used every free moment to teach young Skłodowska's family something. When Marysia was 11 years old, her mother died. At that moment she lost her faith in God and fell into depression. She started her education at the girls' boarding school at the age of 10. She was then educated at the 3rd Female Government Gymnasium, from which she graduated with outstanding results and a gold medal. Skłodowska Curie and her two sisters entered the Flying University when they were only 16 years old. During this time they met eminent professors and significantly increased their knowledge.

                        <p>
                            At the beginning of 1891, Maria decided to go to Paris to begin studying at a French university in November. She chose mathematics and physics as subjects for her studies. Interestingly, she also devoted her free time to amateur theatre acting. After completing her studies in 1893, thanks to Lippmann she received a scientific scholarship for her research on the magnetic properties of steel. Shortly afterwards, she met Peter Curie, who was 8 years older and with whom she married on 26 July 1895. Immediately after their wedding they went on their honeymoon on bicycles which they had received from a friend.

                        <p>
                            At the end of 1897, Marie begins her scientific research with Becquerel's rays in order to obtain her PhD. At that time, she drew valid conclusions, made many scientific hypotheses and proved most of them. Her husband joined in the research. Using chemical transformations, they isolated a new element (Polonium) - named after Poland. Shortly afterwards, in 1898, they reported the discovery of another element - radium. For their achievements, the couple were awarded numerous prizes including the Planie, Lacaze, Nobel. After Pierre's death, Marie devoted herself entirely to her work and in 1911 she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry on her own, thus becoming the first person to receive this prize twice.

                            Marie convinced the French government to build the Radium Institutes. This is what happened. In 2014, the building was erected. Later, four more Nobel laureates came out of it. After the outbreak of World War I, Sklodowska Curie saved many people with the help of X-ray machines. In 1916, she became one of the first women to obtain a driver's license. Five years later, Maria and her daughters traveled to the United States. In 20s, she began to have health problems. She was diagnosed with aplastic anemia. Maria Skłodowska Curie died in a sanatorium on July 4, 1934.
