            <h2 id="1">Childhood and youth</h2>
            <p>Jozef Pilsudski was born on December 5, 1867 in Zulow near Vilnius. He came from a wealthy, patriotic landowning family. His father took part in the January Uprising in 1863. That is why young Piludski, when he enrolled in medicine at the University of Kharkiv after graduating from high school in Vilnius in 1885, joined the "Narodnaya Wola" socialist revolutionary movement there. However, he was expelled from the university for participating in student riots after one year of study. He was also not admitted to the University of Estonia, Dorpat, whose authorities were informed of his political sympathies.</p>

            <h2 id="2">Exile to Siberia</h2>
            <p>On March 22, 1887, Piłsudski was arrested for his involvement in the activities of Vilnius socialists, and on the charge of taking part in a conspiracy to overthrow Tsar Alexander II, he was sent to Siberia for five years - first to Kiryńsk on Lena, then to Tunk.</p>

            <h2 id="3">Polish Socialist Party</h2>
            <p>In 1893, the Polish Socialist Party (PPS) was founded in Warsaw. Piłsudski, who had returned from exile a year earlier, joined the ranks of its Lithuanian branch and in 1894 became a member of the Central Workers' Committee. Six years later, as one of the party's leading leaders, he was arrested again by the Russian authorities and sent to a prison in the Warsaw Citadel. However, a year later, he was transferred to a St. Petersburg hospital after simulating insanity. He escaped from there with the help of one of the doctors, Wladyslaw Mazurkiewicz.</p>

            <h2 id="4">Organization of paramilitary units</h2>
            <p>After returning to Galicia, he continued his political activity. In 1904 he went to Japan, which was during the war with Russia. There, he conducted negotiations with the Mikada government, trying to convince them to create a Polish legion. He did not succeed, but he obtained help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and the PPS Fighting Organization established at the party. This organization became one of the main forces of the 1905 - 1907 revolution. Despite the suppression of a series of riots, riots and clashes with the police, Pilsudski continued his efforts to create a Polish armed force. When in 1906 there was a split in the PPS, a group connected with Pilsudski founded a group that planned an uprising against the tsarist PPS - the Revolutionary Faction.</p>

            <h2 id="5">First World War</h2>
            <p>In 1910, two legally operating organizations were established in the Austrian partition - "Związek Strzelecki" in Lviv and "Towarzystwo Strzeleckie" in Cracow. In 1912, Pilsudski became the Chief Commander of the Riflemen's Unions. At the outbreak of World War I, he became their leader and entered the Kingdom of Poland with them, where he took over a strip of border land abandoned by the Russians. Then, subordinating to Austria, he officially created the Polish Legions and personally commanded their 1st Brigade, while in a strict conspiracy he established the Polish Military Organization (POW). When in 1917 the Legions refused to take an oath of allegiance to Austria and Germany, Pilsudski was arrested and imprisoned in Magdeburg, where he remained until November 1918.</p>

            <h2 id="6">The head of state and the Polish-Bolshevik war</h2>
            <p>After the defeat of Germany, Pilsudski, released from prison, went to Warsaw, where he received the post of commander-in-chief of Polish troops and the mission of creating a national government in the liberated state. On November 14, 1918, he was entrusted with provisional supremacy over the country, and on November 22, he was officially appointed the Provisional Head of State. He held this position until December 9, 1922, when Gabriel Narutowicz was elected the first president of the Republic of Poland. Pilsudski himself focused on defending Poland's regained independence. In the years 1919–1921 he fought battles with the Bolsheviks in the East, culminating in a peace in Riga, under which Poland regained Eastern Galicia. It was during this campaign, in March 1920, that the army offered Pilsudski the mace of the First Marshal of Poland.</p>

        <div class="m">
            <h2 id="7">Withdrawal and return to political life</h2>
            <p>In 1923, however, the Marshal withdrew from active political life, due to the murder of the President of the Republic of Poland, Gabriel Narutowicz, by right-wing groups, who died just a week after being elected to this position during the opening of the exhibition at the „Zachęta” gallery at the hands of Eligiusz Niewiadomski. Pilsudski found it impossible to cooperate with the prime minister of the government, Wincenty Witos, whom he considered morally responsible for the committed act. He withdrew to Sulejówki near Warsaw, where he devoted himself to literary work and opposition propaganda. It was then that he wrote: "Memories about Gabriel Narutowicz" (1923), "About the worth of a soldier of the Legions" (1923), "The Year 1920" (1924), "At the sources of the Rzpltej 's powerlessness" (1924) and "My first battles" (1925).
            However, the situation in the country forced him to re-enter the political arena. Social unrest, the growing number of unemployed and the economic crisis meant that Pilsudski, who had great support and respect from the public, demanded that the Witos cabinet put power down. However, when his appeals were unsuccessful 12 On May 1926, at the head of his faithful troops, the Marshal entered Warsaw and, after three days of fighting, forced both the government and the cabinet of President Stanislaw Wojciechowski to resign. However, he did not accept the position of the President of the Republic of Poland - he took the position of the minister of military affairs, the chairman of the War Council and the general inspector of the Armed Forces. He also held the office of Prime Minister twice - (in the years 1926-1928 and 1930).</p>

            <h2 id="8">Improvement of the state's situation</h2>
            <p>In fact, this marked the end of parliamentary rule in Poland and started a period known as "sanitation" - governments seeking to improve the state of the state. Social support and skilful rhetoric, which ensured his support, allowed Pilsudski to exercise authoritarian power, which even the president (appointed by the Marshal) or the Seym, whose powers were limited by the changes to the Constitution introduced on August 2, 1926, were not able to oppose it.
            In foreign policy, Pilsudski sought to maintain good relations with the USSR (the non-aggression pact of 1932) and Germany (1934). Both agreements were to strengthen Poland's position toward our allies and neighbors.</p>

            <p>The death of Jozef Pilsudski on May 12, 1935, surprised the entire nation. Until almost the last moment, he hid that he had liver cancer. His funeral became a huge national demonstration paying tribute to the late Marshal. The body was buried in the crypt of St. Leonard in the Wawel Cathedral, and the heart, according to his will, was placed in a silver urn and transported to Vilnius, where it was buried in his mother's grave, in the Rossa cemetery.</p>
